I am an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland. In my work I try to figure out how the brain makes people hear sounds. Specifically, I'm interested in the neural mechanisms that underlie the processing of basic auditory features such as pitch and harmonicity. I'm also interested in how the brain handles auditory processing  

For my PhD, I did some work in health psychology, mostly related to pain, anxiety and depression. You can look up my earlier papers [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BuBtcw0AAAAJ&hl=pl).
