I’ve been part of the laboratory since 2023. Within the lab, I handle participant testing, data analysis, and organizational tasks, and I also contribute to study design and manuscript writing. My master’s thesis, “Mismatch responses to varying levels of inharmonicity of complex sounds,” explored auditory perception and predictive processing mechanisms. In 2025, I received the Best Poster Award at the 22nd World Congress of Psychophysiology.

My research interests include predictive processing, perception, sleep, and cognitive functions. I currently work as a teaching assistant at MUG and plan to start a PhD in the near future.

Outside of academia, I work as a full stack developer, love cooking, and am a devoted cat owner.
