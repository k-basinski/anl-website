Welcome to the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory website! We study _how the brain makes people hear sounds_. To this end, we use methods of cognitive neuroscience. Our primary focus is on electroencephalography (EEG) research with event-related potentials (ERPs). Currently, the lab's focus is around [Harmonicity in auditory perception](projects), a project led by [Krzysztof Basiński](people/krzysztof/) and funded by the [National Science Center, Poland](http://ncn.gov.pl).

This lab is part of [Department of Psychology](https://structure.mug.edu.pl/359), [Medical University of Gdańsk](http://gumed.edu.pl) and the Principal Investigator is [Krzysztof Basiński](people/krzysztof/).
