ICAC is a conference that brings together researchers interested in the auditory cortex. A specific aspect of ICAC is that it brings together scientists working with different species (including humans!). This cross-species focus is especially exciting, as it offers great opportunities for translation of animal results to neuro-cognitive models in humans.\nANLab\u0026rsquo;s work was shown during two Poster sessions. Tomek presented his preliminary results with the local-global paradigm while Chris presented (almost) final results on the multi-feature deviants study.\nApart from the wonderful scientific program, there were many cool social activities. We explored caves that turned out to be mines that turned out to be quarries. We sailed on boats. We dined in a gothic church and had fun listening to a live band. Congrats to the organizers for putting all of this together into an exciting experience. We look forward to next ICAC in Magdeburg!\n","date":"1 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/icac-maastricht/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"ANLab at ICAC2025 in Maastricht","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"Highlights from our July conference trip!\nThe Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory had the pleasure of attending the 22nd World Congress of Psychophysiology in Kraków, Poland.

Marcin, Chris, along with Vasiliki Kondyli, Renate Rutiku and Jakub Szewczyk discussed various aspects of predictions, focusing on different processes (vision, audition, somatosensory, linguistic) and different neuroimaging modalities (behavioral, EEG, iEEG, eye-tracking, MEG).\nWe also presented two research posters, sharing our latest findings. Aniela showed results from her Masters thesis, showing a peculiar modulation of mismatch negativity by different amounts of inharmonicity (stay tuned, preprint is almost ready!). Kornelia and Zosia showed results form a multi-feature deviant study that is currently in preparation.\nAniela\u0026rsquo;s poster was recognized with the Best Poster Award, which we are especially honored by - thank you to the award committee, organizers and all who stopped by for a chat!\n","date":"17 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/iop-krakow/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"ANLab at IOP2025 in Kraków","type":"posts"},{"content":"Recently I had a chance to contribute to a review paper on the neural mechanisms of predictive processing, coordinated by the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics. This wonderful initiative aimed at providing a review of current theoretical models and experimental evidence on mechanisms of predictive processing.\nAdditionally, the authors proposed a set of experiments that are aimed to test, if different kinds of mismatch stimuli engage similar or different predictive mechanisms. These experiments will now be performed by OpenScope and a consortium of labs, in mice and primates.\nThe entire project was a collaborative community effort in the spirit of open science. The whole process was coordinated Jerome Lecoq at the Allen Institute and was incredibly open and inclusive - literally everyone had a chance to contribute.

These include speech, animal calls or sounds of musical instruments. Inharmonic sounds are often described as noises, crackles, pops etc.\nHarmonicity is an important property for sound perception and it influences pitch processing, memory or hearing in noisy environments. However, it’s unclear how the brain processes harmonic and inharmonic sounds.\nIn this study we used EEG to record MMN and P3a mismatch responses - markers of auditory prediction error. Inharmonic sounds with a constant jittering pattern generated similar MMN and stronger P3a responses than harmonic sounds.\nIn contrast, MMN responses became undetectable when the jittering pattern changed between consecutive sounds. This suggests that prediction errors are weighted by sequential but not spectral uncertainty.\nUnexpectedly (and excitingly!), inharmonic sounds had significantly smaller P2 peaks than harmonic sounds - a response pattern known as object-related negativity, previously observed with auditory stream segregation.\nI\u0026rsquo;m super-grateful to my co-authors: Sánder, David Quiroga and Peter for all their hard work.\nWe’re now following up on this study in many different ways here in Gdańsk.\nChris\n","date":"30 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/aarhus-preprint/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"New preprint available!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/participate/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Participate","type":"page"},{"content":" I’ve been part of the laboratory since 2023.

The auditory system evolved to infer information about the environment from these waves. Audition is a fundamental sense for humans, as it enables verbal communication and helps with orientation in the world. Although data provided by the hearing apparatus is relatively sparse (in essence, two highly correlated signals), the brain is able to infer surprising amounts of information from this data. Many recent studies suggest that this inference is possible because the brain forms top-down predictions about the incoming auditory stimuli and their causes. These predictions are formed using an internal, generative model that is constantly updated by statistical regularities in the incoming sensory data. A \u0026lsquo;surprise\u0026rsquo; response (or prediction error) is generated when predictions do not fit the sensory data and is used to update the contents of the internal model. These \u0026lsquo;surprise\u0026rsquo; responses in the auditory system are seen as primary sources of mismatch responses (for example the mismatch negativity, MMN) recorded with electroencephalography (EEG). Crucially, it is assumed that these responses are stronger for more reliable stimuli.\nMany sounds in the environment are harmonic complex tones comprised of a fundamental frequency (F0) and a set of frequencies that are integer multiples (harmonics) of that fundamental. Many of these sounds in nature are formed by resonating objects, as is the case in human and animal voices or musical instruments. Conversely, inharmonic sounds have various deviations from the harmonic series. Previous studies have shown that highly harmonic signals tend to produce a more salient pitch sensation, pitch comparisons are easier for harmonic signals and violations of harmonicity impair the intelligibility of concurrent utterances of speech. In this project, we propose that harmonicity can be seen as a basic statistical regularity in the auditory domain that serves as an index of precision. In a series of experiments, we will investigate electrophysiological responses of the brain to harmonic and inharmonic sounds in the form of event-related potentials (ERPs).\nThe results of the proposed project will contribute to the scientific understanding of how the brain is encoding uncertainty on very small timescales required for auditory perception. This is one of the central questions in the science of perception and in neuroscience in general. Results will also contribute to the understanding of pitch perception - a process critical for language, music and other auditory processes.\nExternal collaborators # Alejandro Blenkmann, University of Oslo\nDavid R.
